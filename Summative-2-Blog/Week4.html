        <h3>Reflective Statement
        </h3>
        
        
        <p>This marks the end of our first term and thus the conclusion of this summative. We set out to achieve a similar feat to our last project, however this time with greater complexity. The times in class we got proved very valuable in its knowledge for the coming weeks as due to the well known elephant in the room. The quenrteen proved to be a unique set of circumstances that proved both benefits and problems. Such challenges firstly included my own lack of enthusiasm at times, but mostly the lack of face to face communication and help from others. Rather than entirely hinder me I believe it helped create a sense of independence when not having the constant need to rely on outside help. There were certainly times when someone could have pointed the obvious out, but by completing it on my own it created a deeper understanding and independence for this medium. However a glaring issue was the lack of test subjects available to me. I only live with my father, who is a useful user tester, having a sample size of 1 isn't great. Sending this to friends online was possible but wasn't created as personalized and in depth of a review as face to face. What I did manage to test turned out smoothly. The only major thing was changing what was in the navigation to be more clear. Overall I am happy with the product I produced, sure given more time it could be polished, but there isn't anything I would need to change.</p>
