                    <strong>USER JOURNEY,</strong>  It's been a long week Michael decides to take a well earned break and (as per usual) spends his saturday playing video games. A couple hours drift by and Michael starts to get anxious as exams begin to creep back into his consciousness. Even with taking a break through gaming he can’t shake it and decides to do 30 minute increments of study, then games and repeat. Being a visual learner Micheal prefers watching youtube videos as tutorials for maths and english. Unfortunately he gets distracted and starts watching drones racing videos. Halfway through he gets an ad for a drone convention. Intrigued he clicks, and is guided to there website. Navigating through the photography and video is impressive but not really what he is interested in. However he spot ‘Drone Racing’ on the nav bar and instinctively clicks. The website promises the user an exciting day out where you can race against other people and even purchase the same drone models you fly. The only issue Micheal notices is that the event is not very close and has no way of using public transport, he will have to borrow his mums car for this.

<p><strong>ABOUT,</strong> Michael is in the last weeks of college and is preparing the long voyage into exams. He is a very anxious person and finds he can get overwhelmed easily. Because of this, he spends a lot of time procrastinating from work that needs doing, mostly playing video games and watching tv shows. Michael’s favourite video games are racing and simulators. He really wants to try out racing in the real world but he can’t afford a car to start, let alone even attempt a driver's license. Recently he came across drone racing and has really gotten into it, and has decided to start saving for a drone.

                <p><strong>USER JOURNEY,</strong> During a lunch break while filming an ad Jonathan is in a conversation with another camera man. Specifically the drone operator who they hired for the car ad they are currently working on. They are in a detailed discussion about their passion for filmmaking, during which Jonathan asks about the best way to become qualified for drone filmmaking as he did. From this he recommends trying out a cheaper consumer grade product and building your way up, followed by taking a qualification course. Jonathan is recommend to check out this drone convention that the other camera man goes too, and that it's great for all levels of expertise. Once filming is over Jonathan searches it on his phone. Once directed to the website he is greeted by a simple landing page. Most of the information he needs is there, but he wants more details about the particular shows or speakers but is hard pressed to find anything other than a simple blurb. Despite this he is curious and decides to clear his schedule and go.  </p>

                <p><strong>USER JOURNEY,</strong> While driving home from a long days work Michael notices a billboard for a drone convention, being sure to take a mental note he continues driving. Once home he relaxes himself at his desk, it may be a friday but there are still plenty of things on his mind. His eye catches his camera on the desk, sparking the memory of the billboard earlier. Unfortunately he can’t remember what the brand name was as he was driving past rather fast, not giving much time to install a picture perfect memorization of the board. Luckily google is very forgiving in this respect as a simple ‘drone convention auckland’ is enough to connect the dots and the correct website pops up. Clicking into it Micheal is impressed by the photography it proudly shows off and inspires him even more to purchase a drone. The website isn’t complicated and guides him to all the relevant information, starting with the dates, time and location. Michael takes a note into his busy schedule and continues with his day.
